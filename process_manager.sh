### 5. Process Manager
###   Task: Create a script that takes a process name or PID as 
###   input and offers options to terminate, 
###   restart, or change the priority (nice value) of the process.

##### Clarifications #####

# 1.
# pgrep is a command used to find the id of a process given is name
# What does the -f option:
# pgrep python (this looks for processes that have exactly the name python)
# But if i started a script like: python /home/user/scripts/my_script.py
# The actual command running is python, and my_script.py is just an argument to python.
# If you try to find this process using pgrep my_script.py, it wonâ€™t work because pgrep only looks for the process name, not the whole command.
# Using pgrep -f tells pgrep to look at the entire command line
# With -f, pgrep will search for any process where the whole command (in this case, python /home/user/scripts/my_script.py) contains "my_script.py".
