       The SIZE argument is an integer and optional unit (example: 10K is 10*1024).  Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y,R,Q (powers of 1024) or KB,MB,... (powers of  1000).   Binary
       prefixes can be used, too: KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on.

       The  TIME_STYLE argument can be full-iso, long-iso, iso, locale, or +FORMAT.  FORMAT is interpreted like in [1mdate[22m(1).  If FORMAT is FORMAT1<newline>FORMAT2, then FOR‚Äê
       MAT1 applies to non-recent files and FORMAT2 to recent files.  TIME_STYLE prefixed with 'posix-' takes effect only outside the POSIX locale.  Also the TIME_STYLE en‚Äê
       vironment variable sets the default style to use.

       The WHEN argument defaults to 'always' and can also be 'auto' or 'never'.

       Using color to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and with [1m--color[22m=[4mnever[24m.  With [1m--color[22m=[4mauto[24m, ls emits color codes only when standard output is  con‚Äê
       nected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment variable can change the settings.  Use the [1mdircolors[22m(1) command to set it.

   [1mExit status:[0m
       0      if OK,

       1      if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),

       2      if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).
